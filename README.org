I did a course back in university on signal processing and linear
systems. Unfortunately, that was several years ago and I am not as
fluent on the topic as I would like to be.

I have a side project where I would like to use that knowledge, so it
is time for me to revise it.

This repo is a learning tool for me, where I will be implementing the
signal processing logic as a way to help me revise it.

I am working from the textbook "Signal Processing and Linear Systems"
by B.P. Lathi. International edition, published by Oxford University
Press in 2010.
